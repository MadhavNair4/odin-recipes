        <ol>        
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                    Line a pizza pan with aluminum foil; lay bacon strips 
                    on top.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake bacon in the preheated oven until browned and 
                    crisp, about 15 minutes.

                    Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water 
                    to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, 
                    stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the 
                    bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.

                    Drain bacon slices on paper towels and allow to cool 
                    slightly, about 5 minutes. Place in the bowl of a food 
                    processor; pulse until crumbly.

                    Preheat a smoker to 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees 
                    C). Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mix together cream, Cheddar cheese, Colby-Jack cheese, sour 
                    cream, mayonnaise, butter, and barbeque rub in the warm pasta 
                    pot; add drained macaroni. Mix well and let the cheese melt. 
                    Pour into a 9x13-inch aluminum pan and sprinkle bacon on top.
                </p> 
            </li>

                <p>
                    Place the pan on the rack in the preheated smoker. Cook until 
                    cheese is bubbly, about 3 1/2 hours.
